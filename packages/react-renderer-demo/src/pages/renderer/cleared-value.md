# Cleared value

The value to send upon a submit if the field is empty. This wildcard value can be used to distinguish between an untouched field and a cleared one (it will be only used when field has initialValue). For example if you have a form that edits an entity and you would like to clear an attribute. Some APIs require the value to be set to null to register the change.
